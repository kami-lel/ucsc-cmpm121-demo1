This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

# Acknowledgment 1

This project is inspired by Jacky Pho's work in the repository [cmpm-121-demo-1](https://github.com/jackypho/cmpm-121-demo-1/)

We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Jacky Pho for their inspiring approach in incorporating background imagery into the theme of this project. Their work has greatly influenced our design choices and enhanced the overall aesthetic appeal.
