This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Maozblan for their inspiration to use **line art** as a representation of upgradable tools. Their innovative approach to employing **line art** as a logo not only simplifies complex ideas but also enhances visual clarity and appeal. This minimalist style captures the essence of modern design, allowing us to convey functionality and adaptability with elegance. Maozblan's creativity has significantly influenced our design choices and contributed to the project's overall vision.
